DA Final Project 

The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for users. Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. Collaborative Filltering, Content-Based Filtering is used. And in Collaborative filtering, user-Based and Item-Based Collaborative filtering is used.

There are three major approaches for recommendation systems: (i) content-based, (ii) collaborative, and (iii) Machine learning based model. Broadly, recommendation systems that implement a content-based (CB) approach recommend items to a user that are similar to the ones the user preferred in the past. On the other hand, recommendation systems that implement collaborative filtering (CF) predict usersâ€™ preferences by analyzing relationships between users and interdependencies among items; from these, they extrapolate new associations.
